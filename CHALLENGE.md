# What is a Challenge?
The purpose of a challenge is to verify the identity of a person. This is done by the person providing a piece of information that only they should know. This information is then verified by the other party. This is a common practice in the world of cryptography and security.

### How this works?
1. You will generate 3 random UUIDs and then **ENCRYPT** them with my Public PGP Key.
2. You will then contact me via Discord and provide me with the message containing the 3 **ENCRYPTED** UUIDs.
3. I will then **DECRYPT** the message and reply with the UUID's in plain text.
4. You will then verify they match with the UUIDs you generated and encrypted.

pgp.help is a website where you can paste my Public Key, and then paste the 3 UUIDs you generated. You can then encrypt the message and send it to me via Discord.

### UUID Generation:
You can generate the UUIDs here [UUID Generator](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/). You will need to generate 3 UUIDs.

Why did we pick UUIDs? UUIDs are unique and generated randomly. This means that it is highly unlikely that someone else will generate the same UUIDs as you. This makes it a good choice for a challenge.
